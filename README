Environment
-----------

HyperVisor: Virtualbox 4.3.10
Distribution: ArchBang
Kernel: 3.18.6-1-ARCH
Modified Kernel: 3.18.9
RAM: 2046MB
openjdk version: 1.8.0_31
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM: build 25.31-b07, mixed mode
GCC version: 4.9.2 20141224

Installing Java
---------------

Java Development Kit (JDK) - version 8 
	> sudo pacman -S jdk8-openjdk
	> This should install the Java runtime environment as a dependancy but if
	not then run "sudo pacman -S jre8-openjdk-headless"

Installing Git
--------------

To install Git, run "sudo pacman -S git"

Upgrading the System
-------------------------

To upgrade the system run "sudo pacman -Syu". 

Compiling the Kernel
--------------------

The Arch Linux wiki guide to traditional comilation was used. 
	-"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernels/Compilation/Traditional"

Grab the kernel source
-"wget -c https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.x/linux-3.18.9.tar.xz"

Ensure oom_restart.c is in $SOURCE /mm

Ensure oom_restart() is called in oom_kill.c

Ensure oom_restart.o is listed in the Makefile under $SOURCE/mm
- oom_restart.o should be added to the list of *.o files following the obj-y
  command
- it can also be added by adding this line: "obj-y += oom_restart.h"

Ensure oom_restart.h is added to $SOURCE/include/linux

Build the configuration file
- run "make localmoddconfig" from the Linux source directory to have the .config
 automatically generated based on the currently selected options and used devices
 by the running kernel. 

Run "make"

Execute "./install_kernel.sh" found in the linux source directory. 

Restart and select the advanced options in order to select the new kernel.

Experiments
-----------

The Java experiments are run with the -XmsSIZE and -XmxSIZE where SIZE is the
total amount of memory available on the system. This ensures that the JVM is
able to allocate all the available memory. 

To run the java experiments in java_experiments.sh
-Run "make" in the experiements/java folder
-Run "make exp" within the same folder
-The results can be found in experiments/java/results.txt
